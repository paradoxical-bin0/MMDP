There are lots of bugs by now.

1. I need to clean the app.js to keep only GoogleAuth and not the bcrypt one.
2. I shouldn't be rendering auth_home separately, instead
I have to hide the sign-in, sign-up button after signin/signup and display "Hello Username" instead of Hello user.
3. DB stuff handling is left.
4. Checkout stuff is going to be preety hard.
(Try looking for mastercard etc apis tomorrow.)

Flow:
As user checksout: his plan_type and initial number of images in account has to be stored.
We he re-logins, his info should be saved so that number_of_images left can be updated respectively.

# Additional functionalities like plan changing and free trial is left.

Set default plan as free trial.

5. Sign in Pop-ups left.
6. Add mongoDB code for updating images_left value after clicking on upload button.
7. It's getting confusing at this point.
8. Path bugs.
